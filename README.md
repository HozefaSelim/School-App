# üè´ School Management REST API

This repository contains a RESTful API built using Go and the Fiber web framework. The API provides endpoints for managing schools, classes, teachers, and students. This application demonstrates how to create a robust and scalable API with Go, utilizing GORM for database interactions and Fiber for handling HTTP requests.

## üöÄ Features

- **School Management:** Create, read, update, and delete school records.
- **Class Management:** Manage classes associated with schools, including adding, updating, and removing classes.
- **Teacher Management:** Handle teacher records, associating them with specific schools.
- **Student Management:** Manage student records, associating them with specific classes.
- **CRUD Operations:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for all entities.
- **Relational Data Handling:** Manage relationships between schools, classes, teachers, and students with cascading updates and deletions.
- **JSON API:** JSON formatted responses for all endpoints, making it easy to integrate with front-end applications.
